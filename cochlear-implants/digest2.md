Summary: Procedure & Risks & Results
```
FACTORS THAT EFFECT RESULTS
- age when receiving cochlear
- if hearing loss started before or after developing language skills
- own motivation

BEST CANDIDATES
- Best Adult Candidates:
  - severe to profound hearing loss in both ears
  - experienced limited benefit from hearing Candidates
  - no medical complications for surgery
  - want to be part of hearing world via listening/speaking/speechreading
  - lost hearing post-speech&language development
- Best Child Candidates:
  - profound hearing loss in both ears
  - limited benefit from hearing aids
  - healthy & no medical complications for surgery
  - they & their parents are involved in all the steps, understands their role for success, have realistic expectations
  - willing to do post-surgery habilitation
  - have educational program support to develop auditory skills

PEOPLE INVOLVED
  - audiologist (diagnoses and treats hearing and balance problems)
  - otologist(ear doctor)/surgeon
  - psychologist
  - counselor
  - speech-language pathologist (prevent, assess, diagnose, and treat speech, language, social/cognitive communication disorders)


PROCESS
- Determine Candidacy:
  - ear (otologic) evaluation: otoryngologist examines ear canal and middle ear for active infections/abnormalities
  - physical examination: identify potential problems for general anesthesia
  - hearing (audiologic): extensive hearing tests to determine level of hearing with and without hearing aid
  - X-rays (radiography) examination: MRIs, CT scans to evaluate inner ear anatomy
  - counseling
  - do this to make sure that subject will benefit from CI, has motivation to complete full process & recovery, understands the performative functions of CI and required follow up care and services
- Perform Surgery:
  - mastoidectomy with facial recess approach (MFRA)    - if can't do MFRA, use suprameatal triangle
  - surgery under general anesthesia
  - recommend cavvination prior to procedure to avoid bacterial meningitis
  - Incision behind ear to open mastoid bone leading to middle ear space, opening is made in cochlea and implant electrodes inserted, electronic device at the base of electrode array is placed under the skin behind the ear
- Follow Up Care (@ implant center, local agencies, school distrincts):
    - 4-6 weeks after surgery, get fitted for external parts and activate, program, & adjust (mapping) the implant (takes several days). These visits occur frequently and usually conclude with annual visits
    - extensive rehabilitation services via audiologists, speech-language pathologists, teachers, and counselors
    - learn to listen, improve speech, use speechreading, & handle communication
    - learn how to use implant & how to respond to sounds received (those who havent heard sound before need to be taught what sound is what)

RISKS
- Side Effects:
  Dizziness and weird balance for a few months (generally resolves, except for people over 70)
- Risks:
  - Meningitis (infection of fluid around the brain)
  - Mastoidtis (mastoid bone infection)
  - Otitis  (Inflamation of middle ear)
  - Facial nerve damage
  - Wound infections
  - Risk getting tinnitus (hear ringing/clicking/hissing/roaring when no external sound is present)
  - May hear sound differently (more mechanical/technical/synthetic/artificial)
  - May lose residual hearing
  - Long terms effects of electrical currents on nerves unknown
  - Different levels of success, some failures
  - Different levels of ability to understand language post CI
  - May not be able to upgrade
  - Cannot have some medical examinations/treatments (MRI, neurostimulation, electrical surgery, electroconvulsive therapy, ionic radiation therapy)
  - Must use for the rest of your life, can't go back
  - Implant will react with certain things, so must change lifestyle aspects (metal detectors, phones, statis electricity)
  - external parts cannot get wet

Additional Commentary
```
Because there are so many factors involved in determining whether a candidate should get a CI or not, I wonder how many people get turned away, and for what reason, as well as the percentage of unsuccessful CI's. I am also interested in some first person accounts from people who have gotten a CI successfully, someone who got a failed CI, and someone who does not want a CI.
