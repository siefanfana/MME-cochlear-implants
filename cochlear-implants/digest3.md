Summary: Participant Observation
```
Because cochlear implants bypass the auditory system, it does not actually "cure" deafness. It actually produces artificial sound, which is different than what hearing people would hear. It is also different than what is heard through a hearing aid, as a hearing aid uses the auditory system and amplifies the sound waves detected.

Click [here](https://www.sciencefriday.com/educational-resources/cochlear-implants-hearing-aids-sound-like/) to listen to audio simulations of what audio sounds like with hearing aids vs with a cochlear implant.

With a hearing aid, audio sounds muffled and unclear
With a CI, audio sounds like it's been distorted with robotic tones, and what you hear is different levels of static.

This is why CI receivers must undergo intense speech and language rehabilitation, they must learn to decipher the sounds the CI produces.

Commentary
```
Based off of the audio simulation, it is VERY hard to understand the audio heard through a CI, and feels almost painful to listen to. I would personally get annoyed with having to hear the static sounds, and put in so much energy and effort to try and decipher the sounds sent to my brain. It would be very difficult to keep up in a conversation, let alone in a loud environment with multiple people talking. This makes me wonder whether it is considered worth it for deaf people/heard of hearing people to get a CI, because it is clearly not a "cure".
