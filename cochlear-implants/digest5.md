Summary: Criticisms
```
The strongest objections comes from the DEAF COMMUNITY
- affront to their culture
- Manualism (sign language) vs Oralism
  - Oralism: problematic history
    - involves belief that it's "inherently better to be able to speak and hear". rooted in Audism
    - Alexander Graham Bell - oralist: wanted to wipe out "hereditary deafness": remove deaf faculty in schools, demand stop ASL, and promote deaf intermarriage
- "Normal Body" Ableism
  - Most hearies think that CI/oral approach is the only option/all deaf people want to be "cured" because their lives are supposedly harder
  - deafness does not need to be cured/are not sick
    - COUNTERARGUMENT: CI can be used as a tool to access hearing world without losing deaf identity
  - mastery of hearing/speech should not be a measure of success
  - supposedly deaf people won't live a "normal" life: but 95% of deaf people do
- Hearing People Perspective
  - Deaf people *want* to be part of hearing world: not true
- Deaf culture
  - ASL is huge part of deaf culture
    - People with CI lose huge part of identity: are not "fully" deaf but are not fully hearing either
  - see as "cultural genocide"
  - If child has CI, less likely learn ASL: will "speak" different language than parents: loss of culture & communication
    - *fundamental disagreement: deafness = disability vs culture. But why is it that the former group has the power when the latter group are the ones affected??*

Protests
- Rally (majority Deaf participants) against "Listening and Spoken Language Symposium" (annual event put on by Alexander Graham Bell Association for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing: workshops, product displays, etc)
  - ABG: emphasizes speaking, lip reading, CI > ASL. Have financial stakes in CI's
  - Many angry that ABG misleads hearing parents about how deaf children cannot lead fully functioning, fulfilled lives
  - Protest that AGB functions only to profit $
  - AGB promotes idea that ASL is inferior to English

Deaf culture
- Deaf vs deaf:
  - Deaf: "refer to group of deaf people who share a language" identity
  - deaf: "refer to the audiological condition of not hearing"

CI for Babies Controversy
- Because the earlier the CI is implanted, the more likely it is to be successful, it is recommended that babies born with profound hearing loss/who lose their hearing, get CI's ASAP/before the critical period of language development. This leads to a lot of controversy on whether or not parents should be giving their babies CI's when the baby is still too young to decide for themselves


```
Commentary
```

- Ads/general culture displays CI in a biased manner: probably largely through the fact that the corporations selling/producing CI's have huge funds based on the cost of the CI, and that's all we're seeing
- CI's are the "one answer cure": what *isn't* marketed in CI's are the aftermath/post surgery therapy and all the steps of trying to learn to use the CI afterwards. The success also varies, and this is never shown.
- The CI ads we see mostly are FB videos of babies hearing their mom/dad for the first time: put these videos are **very** biased and do not give a full picture of the CI process. It misinforms the public about how CI's function.
- Why don't deaf people get the larger say/get heard when they are the ones affected?
- There should be more exposure of Deaf people's perspective, and respect/understanding of how they feel
