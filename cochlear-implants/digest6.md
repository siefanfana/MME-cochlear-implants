- "My whole life I'e lived as a Deaf person. I married a Deaf person, I've worked and associated with Deaf people, and I've had no problem in this world. So why are organizations like this trying to take away my right to live the way I want to live, my right to raise my children the way I feel they should be raised" -Jeff Dupree (6th gen Deaf person, volunteers with Audism Free America)
- " - NO ASL, just the CI use over the phone: I'll understand about 25%
    - NO ASL, just the CI in person and no lipreading: I'll understand about 33%
    - CI in person with some lipreading: I'll understand 80% (and I am an excellent lipreader)
    - CI in person with no lipreading, but ASL: I'll understand 100% because of the ASL, and the CI's gonna give me an added layer of sensory input that I don't actually need, but may appreciate.
    - ASL only: I'll understand 100%"" - J. Parrish Lewis (deaf author)
- “I was upset,” Ted Supalla, a linguist who studies ASL at Georgetown University Medical Center, told me. “I never saw myself as deficient ever. The medical community was not able to see that we could possibly see ourselves as perfectly fine and normal just living our lives. To go so far as to put something technical in our brains, at the beginning, was a serious affront.”
- “My implants have given me so much, not just my hearing but my confidence as well,” she says. “I can do what I’ve always wanted to do – work with children — and make something of myself.” - Laura Mcauley
- Paul and Sally Taylor are 73 and from Rochester, New York. Born deaf...Then in 2004, after 65 years of silence, they decided to have implants. “A big part of it was curiosity, combined with living in a time in history when it was possible,” says Irene Taylor Brodsky, their daughter and a film-maker who chronicled her parents’ first year living with implants in an award-winning documentary, Hear and Now.

The dominant emotion portrayed in the film isn’t joy but bafflement. “When you haven’t heard anything your whole life, you don’t have the neurological ability to render meaning from all these sounds,” says Irene. “Mum had daydreams about hearing music for the first time. She’d always listened to heavy metal and rock ’n’ roll because it is very vibration intensive, so she was looking forward to hearing different kinds of music.”

In fact, Sally can now pick out the high notes on a violin, but that’s about it. “I have not yet become a music fan,” Sally confirms in an email.

Many of Paul’s hopes were also dashed. “He wanted to be able to have good conversations with people and not have to repeat things three or four times, which slows everything down,” says his daughter. “He wanted to be able to talk on the phone. None of these things has he been able to do.” Paul also discovered that, far from being adorable, the voices of his grandchildren were rather shrill and often best experienced with the implant turned off.

And yet the couple are not dispirited. “We’re more aware of the environment around us,” they say. Sally now understands why people look at her when she gets her sandwiches out of a plastic bag on a train. Before she had just assumed that, because the bag was soft, it didn’t make a noise.

But the truth is that cochlear implants can provide only limited benefits to those patients who receive them so late in life. Austin Chapman, a 23-year-old from Orange County, California, has had a far more positive experience, but due to a new, powerful set of hearing aids, not an implant. (He says the thought of the surgery scared him.) His blog, where he has been describing his first experiences of hearing music, has attracted thousands of readers.

“When Mozart’s Lacrimosa came on, I was blown away by the beauty of it; it sounded like angels singing and I suddenly realised this was the first time I was able to appreciate music,” he writes. “Tears rolled down my face…”

He’s now on a musical binge, fast-tracking through history, listening to everything from Guillaume de Machaut’s Agnus Dei from the 14th century to Led Zeppelin. When he went to a club during the summer, he couldn’t stop himself from dancing. “I will be going to as many live shows as I can in the next couple years,” he says. But, despite his elation, Austin admits there have also been some disappointments. The sounds of traffic and dogs barking are “ugly”, he says.

And his favourite sound is still silence. It’s something he’s long been familiar with and he has found that, when he turns his hearing aids off, his other senses become sharper. Food tastes better. His golf game improves and wakeboarding and rock climbing are more enjoyable. He only turns his hearing aids on for music and conversation.

“I actually feel bad for hearing people,” he says. “I wish that more people could experience the power and peace of utter silence.”
- "From a deaf person's viewpoint, It's not so much that we are truly against Cochlear Implants as we are against people seeing us as something that needs to be fixed." -Aurora Moon
