Summary: Results & Statistics
```
- Complications
  - 12% minor
  - 3% major:
    - infections
    - facial paralysis 1%
    - device failure 2.5-6%
- Efficacy(successful results)/Results Statistics:
  - 2007 study: large benefits in generic health-related quality of life for postimplantation vs preimplantation
  - 2011 AHRQ (Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality) review: little quality evidence that implanting a CI in both ears at the same time will improve hearing in noisy places vs one CI
  - 2012 AHRQ review: ability to communicate spoken language increases, especially the earlier the implant is done
  - 2015 AHRQ review: some evidence that CI's will improve tinnitus -  but there is also a risk of GETTING tinnitus: ultimately results variable
    - tinnitus suppression rate: 8-45%
    - decrease tinnitus rate: 25-72%
    - no change: 0-36%
    - increase of tinnitus: 0-25%
    - got tinnitus: 0-10%
  - 2016 Systematic review: CI in UHL (Unilateral Hearing Loss) improves sound localization vs other treatments: improved speech perception

Commentary
```
It is interesting that there are so many complications with this treatment (although it it probable that any other treatments for different disabilities or diseases also contain the same risks and unguaranteed levels of success). I am curious to see if there are accounts for those who CI's have not been successful for them, or have increased their health risks and see what their responses are.
