# Tech Timeline
### Cochlear Implants

- 1977: Mona Andersson
  - 1st recipient of "Baha": bone conduction hearing implant by Dr. Graeme Clark
- 1977: Clark's discoveries
  - figures out how to get electrode placed securely in inner ear
  - experimented with blade of grass and shell on beach
  - discovers importance of graded stiffness in design of electrode
- 1977: Engineers Jim Patrick and Ian Forster
  - present circuit diagram for the Mastermos silicon chip that will provide circuitry to 1/10 stimulus channels of first bionic ear
- 1978: Rod Saunders
  - 1st Cochlear recipient with multichannel stimulation
- 1979: "Nucleus"
  - medical device group
  - teams up with Australian Government to develop commercially available CI
- 1980: George Watson
  - 1st recipient
  - portable speech processor with magnet-less headset
- 1982: First Nucleus Implant
  - 1st commercial Nucleus implant
  - done at the University of Melbourne
  - recipient: Graham Carrick
- 1985: FDA Approval
  -FDA approves Nucleus implant system with multichannel CI to be used by deaf adults 18+
- 1989: New mini speech processor
  - smaller mini speech processor (MSP)
  - smaller and lighter than original WSP
  - has MPEAK speech coding strategy: improved performance, better size for children
- 1990: US FDA Approval
  - Approves Nucleus CI system for children 2-17 y/o
- 1997-1998 Product Innovation
  - Introduces SPrint: powerful bodyworn speech processor
  - 1st MRI- safe implant up to 1.5 tesla introduced
- 1998 Product Innovation
  - ESPrit introduced: 1st multichannel BTE processor
  - worn entirely behind ear: no long cables/extra parts
- 1998 Product Innovation
  - Nucleus 24 CI released
  - electrode has more direct stimulation
  - removable magnet for American- Standard titanium casing
- 1999-2000 ACE Speech coding
  - Nucleus ACE speech coding
  - customize sounds via combining benefits of pitch information of the SPEAK strategy
  - higher rates of stimulation
  - customizable to each person's hearing needs
- 2002 Produce Innovation
  - Nucleus 24 Contour Advance
  - Unique Softip feature: protect delicate cochlea structures
  - ESPrit 3G introduced
  - behind-the-ear speech processor with built in telecoil
- 2005 Product Innovation
  - Nucleus Freedom system released
  - 1st water resistant sound processor
- 2008 Cochlear Hybrid
  - combines CI and Hearing Aid technology to overcome high frequency loss
  - High frequency sent to cochlea via implant
  - Low frequency sounds amplified and sent through ear canal via hearing aid
- 2010 Cocholar Baha 3 BI300 Implant
  - 1st bone conduction implant with advanced surface technology
  - reduced time for implant to bond with bone so recipient can access sound sooner
