Summary: General Information
```
- What is it?

  A cochlear implant is a surgically implanted electronic medical device that creates "artificial sound" for the profoundly deaf or hard-of-hearing. There is an external part that is hooked around your ear, as well as an internal part that is surgically implanted underneath your skin. Unlike hearing aids which amplify sound, cochlear implants completely bypass the peripheral auditory system, and instead digitizes sound to artificially send signals to the brain. Cochlear implants cannot "restore hearing," they only give representations of sound, and even this takes time to learn.

- Who is it for?

  Children and adults who are deaf or hard-of-hearing.

  Children are allowed CI's starting at 12 months old, and research shows that children who receive CI's before 18 months old and also receive intense therapy post CI have a greater ability to "hear"/comprehend sound and speak.

  Adults who have lost their hearing later in life learn to associate signals from the CI with sounds they can recall, and therefore do not have to rely on visual cues (sign language/lip reading)

- How does it work?

Usually, sound is heard through their peripheral auditory system as shown in the diagram below.

Your ear receives sound waves, which causes vibrations that are later amplified. These vibrations trigger the hair cells in your cochlea. The hair cells then release potassium ions that stimulate other cells to release a neurotransmitter that causes the cochlear nerve to send signals to the brain, which then receives the sound.


Deafness/Hard-of-hearing is caused by damage to the cochlea (hair cells in the inner ear).

Therefore, cochlear implants substitute the work of the cochlea and provide sound signals that are sent to the brain.

1. The microphone (external) detects sounds around you
2. The speech processor worn behind your ear (external), which also contains the battery that powers the entire CI system, filters and arranges the sounds detected by the microphone.
3. The transmitter (external) sends the processed sound across the skin to the receiver/stimulator using electromagnetic induction
4. The receiver/stimulator (internal) then translates the sounds into digital code (electric impulses).
5. The electrode array (a group of electrodes) (internal) collects the impulses and sends them to the auditory nerve which then sends signals to the brain where the sound is processed.

Additional Commentary
```
- Some of these sources, especially the 1st (cochlear.com) present cochlear implants as a holy grail solution to deafness/hard-of-hearing. It makes is seem as though it should be a given that anyone who struggles with hearing should get a cochlear in order to solve their "problem" and better enjoy life. However, my issue with this is that it enforces stigmas that those who are deaf/hard-of-hearing therefore lead a "damaged" or "lesser" life and are people who are "damaged" that must be fixed. This is definitely not the case. Deaf culture is rich, and in many ways, those who are deaf/hard-of-hearing lead more enriched lives in other aspects than hearing people.
- Furthermore, the 1st (cochlear.com) article also does not address any risks, failures, or side effects of cochlear implants. It makes it seem like a holy solution. However, there must be risks and reasons that many people do not get CI's that they do not disclose.
- The information that children who receive CI's prior to the age of 18 months usually receive better results brought up the question of accessibility of CI's. These are undoubtedly expensive and not everyone who wants/needs one can afford one, especially within the time frame of greater success. Questions I want to further explore is how accessible CI's are (study the socioeconomic data of CI recipients) as well as any government/health plan/supplementary financial aid that may be provided for those who want a CI but cannot afford one.
