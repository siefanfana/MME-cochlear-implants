### Cochlear Implants ###

```
Who is this technology meant for?
```
- deaf/profoundly hard-of-hearing people

```
Who was this technology created by?
```
- scientists, audiologists, hearing people

```
What is the purpose of this technology?
```
- to allow deaf/h-o-d people to "hear" artificially, and as a result, develop better speech, and supposedly integrate them into "mainstream society"

```
Who is this technology bias against?

This technology is (ironically) biased against deaf people. By pushing this technology, it inadvertently gives off the message that deaf people need to be "fixed" and that there is something wrong with them. It says that people need hearing in order to "function properly" and that without it, these people are somehow disadvantaged or living a "lesser" life. This is not an unsupported claim. Given the research, the biggest opponents to cochlear implants is the deaf community themselves. To them, deafness is not a disability, it actually enriches their lives, and they wear it proudly as part of their identity. They are living perfectly functioning and fulfilling lives, and are often offended when hearing people tell them that they *need* a cochlear implant, or insinuate that it would "cure" them or solve all of their problems. Sadly, the group in which this technology does not actually effect, has the most control over how this technology is perceived by the general public. Cochlear implants therefore support the idea that speech is the superior form of communication as a byproduct. Notably, those developing and funding cochlear implants are hearing people and large corporations seeking profit. The advertisements for cochlear implants are also very one-sided, showing only a minuscule moment in the entire brutal process to give the public and uninformed perspective of what a cochlear implant is and how the process actually works. An important question that should be brought up is: Why is there so much focus put on trying to eliminate deafness and "mainstream" deaf people instead of trying to teach other people to learn sign language - which is just another language like Chinese, German, etc. Sign language isn't just for the deaf or hard-of-hearing. It can prove to be extremely useful as a form of communication in society - if people actually give it a chance and try to learn it. Sign language would be a much more effective way to communicate in loud environments, in areas that you aren't supposed to talk, or when you're mouth is full. When you meet someone who doesn't speak the same language as you, you communicate through motions - which is essentially what sign language is. So despite all the benefits of learning sign language - auditory system functionality aside - why do hearing people not try to learn it? We spend so much time, especially in high school, learning Spanish, Chinese, French, etc., so how come ASL is never put on the list? The fact that we spend so much time and effort arguing profusely for things like cochlear implants in order to try to let deaf people "hear" so they can supposedly communicate better with hearing people, but rarely ever think to have hearing people put in the effort to learn ASL, which would be extraordinarily beneficial regardless what your hearing is, speaks volumes about our society and how it operates.
