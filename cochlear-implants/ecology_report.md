### Cochlear Implants ###


The initial purpose of cochlear implants are to provide artificial hearing for deaf/profoundly hard of hearing people. However, beyond the literal utility of this technology, there lies a larger social conversation in how this technology resonates within communities and certain cultures. As demonstrated by the outraged response from the Deaf community, cochlear implants have a larger effect than just providing artificial hearing to its recipients. Cochlear implants insinuate the idea that deaf people are broken and need to be fixed. "From a deaf person's viewpoint, It's not so much that [they] are truly against Cochlear Implants as [they] are against people seeing [them] as something that needs to be fixed" (Moon, Aurora). The perception of seeing differently-abled people as living a "lesser" or more "unfulfilled" and difficult life is something often ingrained into our heads. The reality is, deaf people live rich lives and possess their own thriving Deaf culture. However, cochlear implants say otherwise. Proponents and corporations that produce cochlear implants claim that deaf people need cochlear implants to be integrated into "mainstream society." Many of the corporations and groups, such as the Alexander Graham Bell Association advocate for the elimination of ASL in favor of oral speech. This argument leads to a narrow mindset and pushing away from accepting diversity. Instead of accepting various ways of communication, none lesser than the other, it puts speech as the superior means of communicating. Rather than encouraging others to learn ASL, which would be helpful regardless of hearing levels, it enforces the idea that it is the Deaf community that needs to change and "fix" their supposedly broken parts. Perhaps it is time that instead of trying to mash everyone into the same mold, we take the time to appreciate and understand the nuances that exist between us and learn from one another equally. The invention and development of cochlear implants is not as simple as a neutral technology. It is part of a much larger social conversation on ableism, acceptance, and willingness to embrace methods/culture/ways outside of the majority.
