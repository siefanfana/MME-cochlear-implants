# Guiding Questions: Cochlear Implants
### 02/07/18

##### 1. Main idea behind technology
###### -What is it? What is it for?
- surgically implanted electronic device
- provides *sense/perception of sound* to profoundly deaf/severely hard of hearing - ** not a cure for deafness **

###### - How does it work?
- bypasses most of the peripheral auditory system
  - receives sound, converts to movement in hair cells in cochlea, hair cells release potassium ions that stimulate other celss to release neurotransmitters that make cochlear nerve send signal to brain to create experience of sound
- Device picks up sound, digitizes, converts digitized sound to electrical signals, transmits signals to electrodes embedded in cochlea, stimulates cochlear nerve, sends signal to brain
- External Parts:
  - 1+ mics
  - speech processor that filters sound: prioritizes audible speech
  - transmitter: sends power and processed sound signals across the skin to internal device through electromagnetic induction
- Internal Parts:
  - Receiver/stimulator: receives signal from speech processor and converts to electric impulses
  - Electrode array: embedded in the cochlea


##### 2. Important people/organizations
###### - Names + Who they are, Relationship to research area
- DR. WILLIAM HOUSE:
  - American otologist, physician, and medical researcher
  - "Father of Neurotology"
  - 1961: invented the 1st implant
- BLAIR SIMMONS & ROBERT J. WHITE:
  - 1964 implanted 6 channel electroid in patient at Standford
- GRAEME CLARK // INGEBORG HOCHMAIR + ERWIN HOCHMAIR
  - each independently developed and commercialized modern multichannel CI
  - CLARK: Australian Professor of Otolaryngology at University of Melbourne
    - invented the Bionic Ear (multichannel cochlear implant)

    - help create first micro-electronic multichannel CI
    - cofounded MED-EL with husband: CEO & CTO
    - 2013: honored with Lasker-DeBakey Clinical Medical Research Award fro developing modern cochlear implant
  - 1977 December: Hochmair's first implantation in patient
  - 1978 August: Clark's first implantation in patient
- COCHLEAR LIMITED (australia) // ADVANCED BIONICS (usa) // MED-EL (china)
  - approved CI manufacturers as of 2013

##### 3. Important historical events/milestones
###### - Development of Technology & Why it's noteworthy
  - 1977: Mona Andersson
    - 1st recipient of "Baha": bone conduction hearing implant by Dr. Graeme Clark
  - 1977:Clark's discoveries
    - figures out how to get electrode placed securely in inner ear
    - experimented with black of grass and shell on beach
    - discovers importance of graded stiffness in design of electrode
  - 1977: Engineers Jim Patrick and Ian Forster
    - present circuit diagram for the Mastermos silicon chip that will provide circuitry to 1/10 stimulus channels of first bionic ear
  - 1978: Rod Saunders
    - 1st Cochlear recipient with multichannel stimulation
  - 1979: "Nucleus"
    - medical device group
    - teams up with Australian Government to develop commercially available CI
  - 1980: George Watson
    - 1st recipient
    - portable speech processor with magnet-less headset
  - 1982: First Nucleus Implant
    - 1st commercial Nucleus implant
    - done at the University of Melbourne
    - recipient: Graham Carrick
  - 1985: FDA Approval
    -FDA approves Nucleus implant system with multichannel CI to be used by deaf adults 18+
  - 1989: New mini speech processor
    - smaller mini speech processor (MSP)
    - smaller and lighter than original WSP
    - has MPEAK speech coding strategy: improved performance, better size for children
  - 1990: US FDA Approval
    - Approves Nucleus CI system for children 2-17 y/o
  - 1997-1998 Product Innovation
    - Introduces SPrint: powerful bodyworn speech processor
    - 1st MRI- safe implant up to 1.5 tesla introduced
  - 1998 Product Innovation
    - ESPrit introduced: 1st multichannel BTE processor
    - worn entirely behind ear: no long cables/extra parts
  - 1998 Product Innovation
    - Nucleus 24 CI released
    - electrode has more direct stimulation
    - removable magnet for American- Standard titanium casing
  - 1999-2000 ACE Speech coding
    - Nucleus ACE speech coding
    - customize sounds via combining benefits of pitch information of the SPEAK strategy
    - higher rates of stimulation
    - customizable to each person's hearing needs
  - 2002 Produce Innovation
    - Nucleus 24 Contour Advance
    - Unique Softip feature: protect delicate cochlea structures
    - ESPrit 3G introduced
    - behind-the-ear speech processor with built in telecoil
  - 2005 Product Innovation
    - Nucleus Freedom system released
    - 1st water resistant sound processor
  - 2008 Cochlear Hybrid
   - combines CI and Hearing Aid technology to overcome high frequency loss
   - High frequency sent to cochlea via implant
   - Low frequency sounds amplified and sent through ear canal via hearing aid
  - 2010 COcholar Baha 3 BI300 Implant
   - 1st bone conduction implant with advanced surface technology
   - reduced time for implant to bond with bone so recipient can access sound sooner
   
##### Connections between cochlear implants & other technology
- HEARING AID:
  - amplifies sounds so they can be detected by damaged ears
  - still follows the auditory system
- COCHLEAR IMPLANTS:
  - bypasses damaged portion of the ear and directly stimulates auditory nerve
  - "artificial hearing"
